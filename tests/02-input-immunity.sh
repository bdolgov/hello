# README section 9.1 asserts an attack surface of zero: the program reads
# no arguments, no environment, no stdin, and no files. That is a strong
# claim and this suite is the evidence for it.
#
# Conventional fuzzing is not applicable to a program with no input, so
# this suite inverts the technique: it supplies every category of hostile
# input a caller could supply and asserts that the output does not vary.

# through to a skip when it is unavailable. shellcheck cannot see that, so
# the warning is suppressed here rather than in a blanket file-level
